# swarm-and-evolutionary-algorithms-for-bilevel-optimization-problem

A lot of optimization problems and decision-making processes faced by public and private organizations are hierarchical in sense that decisions at the top level are influenced by lower-level actors. Decision makers at the top level are usually fully aware of the issues at the bottom, while those at lower levels oversee the leaders' decisions and optimize their own strategies.

Bilevel optimization problems are a class of complex optimization problems in which one problem contains the other as a constraint. Their structure suggests that the optimal solution to the lower level problem is a suitable candidate for the upper level optimization problem.

Approbation of swarm intelligence tools for solving bilevel optimization problems on test examples was carried out. The obtained results are compared with evolutionary procedures for solving bilevel optimization problems on test examples (BLEAQ and BPSOQ algorithms). The most efficient algorithm is adapted for solving problems of bilevel optimization on transport networks (PSODPâ€“LeBlanc algorithm with dynamic inertia coefficient). Efficient procedures for solving the problem of transport network topology optimization using the constructed heuristics are implemented.
